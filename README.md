# Resume Builder

This is a simple memory game. You click each image once, it shuffles after each click, and if you click the same image twice the game is over 

My favorite part of this project was the cartoon animals. Originally I was going to use random objects but I saw the animals and new it would be perfect.

### Future Features
- Add multiple difficulties, i.e., you can select between 12, 16, 20, or 30 cards.
